# Power-Bi-Python-Projects
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the 2024 Indian Lok Sabha Election results using data science and visualization tools. It features both a Python-based analytical module and a Power BI dashboard to explore electoral trends, party performances, and candidate-specific outcomes.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to transform raw election data into actionable insights. By leveraging Python for deep-dive statistical analysis and Power BI for interactive reporting, this repository offers a dual-approach to understanding the democratic process.

Key Features

Comprehensive Data Cleaning: Utilizes Python's pandas library to process the election_results_2024.csv dataset, handling data types and ensuring numerical accuracy for margin calculations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Party Performance: Analyzes total seats won by each party and visualizes the distribution using bar plots and pie charts.
Victory Margins: Identifies candidates with the highest and lowest margins of victory (e.g., Shankar Lalwani vs. Ravindra Dattaram Waikar).
High-Profile Comparisons: Compares vote counts for key political figures such as Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, and Amit Shah across their respective constituencies.
Visualizations: Includes a suite of informative plots created with matplotlib and seaborn, such as victory margin histograms and top trailing party analyses.
Interactive Dashboard: A Power BI project file (.pbix) that allows users to interactively filter and explore the election results through a dynamic UI.

Tech Stack

Python: Core analysis and data manipulation.
Pandas: Data handling and aggregation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting.
Power BI: Interactive business intelligence reporting.

How to Use
Python Analysis: Open the provided project notes or Jupyter notebook to see the step-by-step code for importing the dataset, calculating metrics, and generating plots.
Power BI: Open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop to explore the interactive dashboard.
