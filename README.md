🗳️ Election 2024: Loksabha Data Analysis & Visualization
An end-to-end data analytics project exploring the 2024 Indian General Election results. This project combines the statistical power of Python with the interactive storytelling of Power BI to provide deep insights into electoral trends, party performance, and constituency-level metrics.

🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the 2024 Loksabha election results to understand the democratic landscape of India. By processing raw election data, we identify key victory drivers, high-profile winners, and the distribution of seats across various political parties.

Core Objectives:
Data Processing: Cleaning and transforming raw CSV data using Python.

Statistical Analysis: Calculating victory margins and vote distributions.

Interactive Visualization: Building a dynamic dashboard for stakeholders to explore results by state, party, and candidate.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Business Intelligence: Power BI (DAX, Power Query)

Dataset: Election Commission of India (2024 Results)

📂 Project Structure
Election_Analysis.ipynb: Python notebook containing data cleaning, EDA, and margin calculations.

Election_2024_Dashboard.pbix: Power BI file featuring interactive charts and maps.

election_results_2024.csv: The primary dataset used for analysis.

📊 Key Features & Insights
1. Python Analytical Module
Using Python, we performed a granular analysis of the results:

Margin Analysis: Identified the highest and lowest victory margins (e.g., Shankar Lalwani's record lead in Indore).

High-Profile Tracking: Automated comparison of vote counts for key leaders like Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, and Amit Shah.

Trailing Party Analysis: Visualized which parties consistently came in second place across different regions.

2. Power BI Interactive Dashboard
The .pbix dashboard provides a macro-view of the election:

Party-wise Seat Share: A dynamic pie chart showing the distribution of the 543 seats.

State-wise Performance: Hover-over maps to see which party dominated specific regions.

Search Functionality: Filter results by Constituency or Candidate name to see specific victory details.

📖 How to Run
For Python: Ensure you have pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib installed. Run the notebook to generate statistical plots.

For Power BI: Download the .pbix file and open it in Power BI Desktop to interact with the visualizations.

📈 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the synergy between Python (for back-end data crunching) and Power BI (for front-end user engagement). It serves as a template for how data science can be applied to large-scale public datasets to drive transparency and insight.
